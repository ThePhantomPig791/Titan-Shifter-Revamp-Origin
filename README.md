# Titan-Shifter-Revamp-Origin
A datapack that brings Titan Shifters from the anime Attack On Titan into Minecraft using the Origins mod! User_NULL created the base pack with only one titan, but I've gotten his permission to update it!

Credits: 
First of all, user_NULL#3958 (discord) did most of the framework here. I'm only expanding the pack to have more content.
Second of all, The Katt in The Hat#0662 (discord) found the skins and edited some of them. Huge thanks to them!!!!!
Please, please, please go show them some love for the amazing work they've done!
