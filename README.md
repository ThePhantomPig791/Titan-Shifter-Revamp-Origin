# Titan-Shifter-Revamp-Origin
A datapack that brings Titan Shifters from the anime Attack On Titan into Minecraft using the Origins mod! User_NULL created the base pack with only one titan, but I've gotten his permission to update it!

Second of all, The Katt in The Hat#0662 (discord) found the skins and edited some of them. Huge thanks to them!!!!!
Please, please, please go show them some love for the amazing work they've done!

Attack Titan:
-  🧍 Power of The Titans: Pressing your Primary Key allows you to become a 15 block-tall Titan with massive reach and 10+ hearts. (This has a cool down of 3 minutes, and the maximum time to pilot the Titan is 2 minute 30 seconds before you are forcefully ejected)

-  ☠  Skeletal Remains: Pressing your Primary Key again ejects you from your titan body early, leaving behind a massive steaming (AI-less) Skeleton. (Has an increased chance to drop Skulls)

-  ⛈ To You, in 2000 Years: When you transform, lightning hails from the sky and does a radius of pretty decent damage to surrounding entities.

-  💓 Titan Regeneration: You have permanent Regeneration 4, in Titan or Human form. You emit steam as you heal.

-  💎 Crystal Hardening: In titan form, pressing your Secondary Key ejects you from your body and leaves behind a crystal deposit, with a skeleton inside!

-  👕 Massive Body: You are unable to wear ANY form of armor in titan form. (They would break as soon as you transformed anyway)

-  🥩  Large Appetite: You exhaust very quickly in titan form.


Female Titan:
-  🧍 Power of The Titans: Pressing your Primary Key allows you to become a 14 block-tall Titan with massive reach and 10+ hearts. (This has a cool down of 3 minutes, and the maximum time to pilot the Titan is 2 minute 30 seconds before you are forcefully ejected)

Colossal Titan (if playing on a public server I recommend disabling this origin, it is VERY destructive):
-  🧍 Power of The Titans: Pressing your Primary Key allows you to become a 60 block-tall Titan with massive reach and 10+ hearts. (This has a cool down of 3 minutes, and the maximum time to pilot the Titan is 2 minute 30 seconds before you are forcefully ejected)

-  💨 You Fought Well, Right Up To The End: In titan form, sneaking and pressing your Secondary Key will make you emit steam for about 30 seconds, lighting any nearby mob on fire. Once the time is up, your titan disappears in a puff of smoke, without leaving a trace.

-  👕 Massive Body: You are unable to wear ANY form of armor in titan form. (They would break as soon as you transformed anyway)

How to install:
Install the datapack.
Install FabricTailor (skin changing mod, pack won't work without it) (It can be server-side only, meaning people connecting to the server don't need to install it)
Install Pehkui (size changing mod)
Put the datapack in the datapacks folder of the world 
You should be good to go! Select the Subject of Ymir origin and select your Titan!

FAQ: 
**I get a message about not being able to change my skin and how I need to wait! Help!**/
Go into the mod config for fabrictailor on the server and change the delay to -1.

**I can't find the colossal titan! Help!**/
In order to select the colossal, you need to get it with the random option. When selecting it, there is a 1 in 10 chance for you to get the colossal. If you don't mind cheating, you can also use ``/origin set @s origins:titan usernull:colossal``.

DM me about any bugs or issues, please and thanks!
