# Titan-Shifter-Revamp-Origin
A datapack that brings Titan Shifters from the anime Attack On Titan into Minecraft using the Origins mod! User_NULL created the base pack with only one titan, but I've gotten his permission to update it!

**FAQ and configuration at the bottom of page**

Credits: 
First of all, user_NULL#3958 (discord) did most of the framework here. I'm only expanding the pack to have more content.
Second of all, The Katt in The Hat#0662 (discord) found the skins and edited some of them. Huge thanks to them!!!!!
Please, please, please go show those two some love for the amazing work they've done!

-  💨 You Fought Well, Right Up To The End: In titan form, sneaking and pressing your Secondary Key will make you emit steam for about 30 seconds, lighting any nearby mob on fire. Once the time is up, your titan disappears in a puff of smoke, without leaving a trace.

- ⛈️ Pure Transformation: You can transform any player within 150 blocks into a Pure Titan. These players will have no control over the titan, and when 2 and a half minutes are up, they will be ejected, leaving behind a quick to dissolve skeleton. Titan Shifters, however, can resist this forced transformation using the power of their own Titan.

- 🔺 No Restrictions: Due to your strong connections with the Paths, you can alter the size of your Titan with save/load hotbar activators, however, untransforming will revert the Titan's skeleton back to normal.

How to install:
- Install the datapack.
- Install FabricTailor (skin changing mod, pack won't work without it) (It can be server-side only, meaning people connecting to the server don't need to install it)
- Install Pehkui (size changing mod)
- Put the datapack in the datapacks folder of the world 
- You should be good to go! Select the Subject of Ymir origin and select your Titan!

___

FAQ: 

**I get a message about not being able to change my skin and how I need to wait! Help!**
- Go into the mod config for fabrictailor on the server and change the delay to -1.

**I can't find the Colossal titan! Help!**
- In order to select the Colossal, you need to get it with the random option. When selecting it, there is a 1 in 10 chance for you to get the Colossal. If you don't mind cheating, you can also use ``/origin set @s origins:titan usernull:colossal``.

**I can't find the Founding titan! Help!**
- Read above, but replace Colassal with Founding, but the chance is about 1/30.

___

__Configuration:__

**For a list of all of the config options: type ``/function usernull:config/`` and see what is autofilled. Alternatively, read below.

You can enable or disable each Titan individually, with ``/function usernull:config/can_select/(titan)_(enable/disable)``.
You can enable or disable the Colossal Titan's vaporizing ability with ``/function usernull:config/powers/colossal_vaporize_(enable/disable)``.
You can enable or disable the Colossal Titan's nuke ability with ``/function usernull:config/powers/colossal_nuke_(enable/disable)``.

These config options apply globally, not just for you, and doing ``/reload`` with reset them to their defaults (all enabled).
